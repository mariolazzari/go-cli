And Go is an ideal language for writing command line applications—distribution is a single static executable and it’s easy to cross compile. In this course, learn how to write effective command line applications in Go. Instructor Miki Tebeka covers parsing arguments, validation, subcommands, testing, building, shipping, and much more.
